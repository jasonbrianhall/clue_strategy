## Basic Setup

### Tracking System
Create a comprehensive tracking grid:
- Rows: All cards (6 suspects, 6 weapons, 9 rooms)
- Columns: Each player (including yourself) + Solution

Example grid format:
```
Card       | You | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 | Solution
-----------|-----|----|----|----|----|----|---------
Mustard    |  ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |    ?
Plum       |  ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |    ?
...        |  ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |    ?
Knife      |  ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |    ?
...        |  ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |    ?
Kitchen    |  ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |    ?
...        |  ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |    ?
```

Use a sophisticated dependency tracking system:
- ✓: Player definitely has this card
- ✗: Player definitely does NOT have this card
- Crossed off (—): Card is eliminated from being in the solution
- ?: Completely unknown status
- ?Red: Cards from the same suggestion shown to a player (first dependent possibility group)
- ?Green: Cards from a second independent suggestion shown to the same player
- ?Blue: Cards from a third independent suggestion shown to the same player
- Additional colors: For 4+ independent suggestion groups (or use 1, 2, 3... with mental note)
- 1,2,3...: Numbered groupings for tracking related suggestions (correlated dependencies)
- Circle: Cards confirmed to be in the solution

Critical deduction rules:
1. If you confirm a card with a checkmark (✓) from any color group, erase all other cards with the same color mark from that player's column
2. If you confirm a card with a checkmark (✓) from any number group, erase all other cards with the same number from that player's column
3. If you eliminate all but one card from a color or number group, that remaining card must be held by the player - mark it with ✓
4. When a player has a card, that card is crossed off (—) from being in the solution
5. If you cross off 5/6 suspects, 5/6 weapons, or 8/9 rooms from the solution, circle the remaining card as it must be in the solution
6. If a player has a hand size of N (typically 3-4 cards):
   - Once you've confirmed N cards for them (N checkmarks), mark ✗ for all other cards in their column
   - If they have (N-1+) confirmed cards and one independent color group, mark ✗ for all other cards in their column

## Core Algorithms

### 1. Dependency Tracking Algorithm
The foundation of efficient Clue solving is tracking dependencies between cards:

```
When a player shows a card in response to a suggestion:
    If no previous marks exist for these cards for this player:
        Mark all three suggested cards with ?Red
    
    If a different suggestion was previously shown by this player:
        Mark these new cards with ?Green (or next color in your system)
    
    If these cards overlap with previously shown suggestions:
        Mark them with numbers (1, 2, 3...) to track correlation
        
When you confirm a player has a specific card:
    Mark that card with ✓
    Erase all color marks of the same color for that player
    Erase all number marks of the same number for that player
    Mark ✗ for this card for all other players and Solution
    
When you eliminate all but one card in a color or number group:
    That remaining card must be held by the player
    Mark it with ✓ and follow the confirmation steps above
```

### 2. Card Counting Algorithm
Track the total number of known cards for each player:

```
For each player:
    Count their confirmed cards (marked with ✓)
    Track this against their total hand size (typically 3-4 cards)
    
If player has N cards and N cards are marked ✓:
    Mark all remaining unmarked cards with ✗ for this player
```

### 4. Solution Tracking Algorithm
Systematically tracking cards that are eliminated from being in the solution:

```
When a player is confirmed to have a card:
    Cross off (—) that card from being in the solution
    
For each category (suspects, weapons, rooms):
    Count how many cards are crossed off (—) in the Solution column
    
    If 5 of 6 suspects are crossed off:
        The remaining suspect must be the murderer
        Circle this card in the Solution column
        
    If 5 of 6 weapons are crossed off:
        The remaining weapon must be the murder weapon
        Circle this card in the Solution column
        
    If 8 of 9 rooms are crossed off:
        The remaining room must be the murder location
        Circle this card in the Solution column
```

### 5. Hand Size Completion Algorithm
Leveraging knowledge of each player's hand size for powerful deductions:

```
For each player with a hand size of N (typically 3-4 cards):
    
    If player has N confirmed cards (N checkmarks):
        Mark ✗ for all other cards in their column
        
    If player has (N-1) confirmed cards AND one independent color group:
        One card from that color group must be in their hand
        All other unmarked cards can be marked with ✗
        
    If player has (N-2) confirmed cards AND two independent color groups:
        They must have exactly one card from each color group
        All other unmarked cards can be marked with ✗
        
    Example:
        Player has hand size 3
        You've confirmed they have Colonel Mustard (✓)
        They've shown cards from two independent suggestions:
            ?Red: Mrs. White, Knife, Ballroom
            ?Green: Professor Plum, Rope, Kitchen
        They must have exactly one ?Red card and one ?Green card
        Mark ✗ for all other cards in their column
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Response Pattern Analysis
Track which suggestions receive responses from which players:

```
For each suggestion:
    Record which players could not show cards
    If a player repeatedly cannot answer suggestions containing a specific card:
        They likely don't have that card
        (Not definitive but increases probability)
```

### 2. Minimum Information Suggestions
Strategic questioning to maximize information gain:

```
When making a suggestion:
    Include 1-2 cards you already know aren't in the solution
    Include 1-2 cards you're trying to gather information about
    This forces players to reveal only the cards you're interested in
```

### 3. Second-Order Deductions
Look for patterns across multiple suggestions:

```
If Player 1 shows a card for suggestion (Green, Knife, Library)
And Player 1 shows a card for suggestion (Green, Rope, Library)
And Player 1 cannot show a card for suggestion (Green, Revolver, Kitchen):
    Player 1 likely has Green or Library (or both)
    Player 1 definitely doesn't have Revolver or Kitchen

If a possibility is marked with both a colored question mark and a numbered question mark; 
it is more likely but not guaranteed they have that card.  If that possibility gets eliminated,
usually will result in a cascade of eliminations.
```

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Two-Turn Solution Method
A high-efficiency approach for rapid solving:

**Turn 1:**
- Make a suggestion with 3 cards you believe are unlikely to be in the solution
- One player will show you a card - mark it with ✓ for them
- Other players who can't show cards: mark all 3 suggestion cards with ✗ for them

**Turn 2:**
- Based on your updated grid, identify the most uncertain category
- Make a suggestion with cards that will verify your strongest suspicions
- Combine with other algorithms to potentially solve the case

### 2. Priority Information Gathering
Focus on the most valuable information first:

```
1. First prioritize eliminating entire categories
   (e.g., determine which suspect is in the solution)
2. Then focus on the remaining categories
3. Always make suggestions that could potentially provide definitive answers
```

### 3. Card Scarcity Tracking
Pay attention to which cards are most frequently known:

```
For each card in the game:
    Count how many players definitely don't have it (marked with ✗)
    Cards with the highest count are more likely in the solution
```

## Example Cases

### Example 1: Basic Deduction
### Example 1: Dependency Tracking
**Scenario:**
- Player 1 suggests: Colonel Mustard, Knife, Ballroom
- Player 3 shows a card to Player 1
- No cards are currently marked with ✗ for Player 3

**Analysis:**
- Mark ?Red for Player 3: Colonel Mustard, Knife, Ballroom
  (This indicates Player 3 has exactly one of these three cards)
- Later, if you discover Player 3 has the Knife:
  - Change Knife to ✓ for Player 3
  - Erase the ?Red marks for Colonel Mustard and Ballroom

### Example 2: Independent Suggestions
**Scenario:**
- Player 2 previously showed a card for: Colonel Mustard, Knife, Ballroom (marked as ?Red)
- Player 2 now shows a card for: Mrs. White, Rope, Kitchen

**Analysis:**
- Mark ?Green for Player 2: Mrs. White, Rope, Kitchen
  (These are independent from the previous red-marked group)
- If you later confirm Player 2 has Mrs. White:
  - Change Mrs. White to ✓ for Player 2
  - Erase the ?Green marks for Rope and Kitchen
  - The ?Red marks remain unchanged (still possible)

### Example 6: Hand Size Deduction
**Scenario:**
- Player 2 has a hand size of 3 cards
- You've confirmed they have the Rope (✓)
- They've shown cards from two independent suggestions:
  1. Mrs. White, Knife, Ballroom (marked as ?Red)
  2. Professor Plum, Revolver, Kitchen (marked as ?Green)

**Analysis:**
- Player 2 has 1 confirmed card (Rope) and 2 independent suggestion groups
- Since they have only 3 cards total, they must have:
  - Rope (already confirmed)
  - Exactly one card from the ?Red group (White, Knife, or Ballroom)
  - Exactly one card from the ?Green group (Plum, Revolver, or Kitchen)
- Mark ✗ for Player 2 for all other cards not in these groups
- This significantly narrows your search space

### Example 7: Complete Category Elimination
**Scenario:**
- Through various deductions, you've crossed off (—) 5 of the 6 suspects from being in the solution:
  - Colonel Mustard: —
  - Professor Plum: —
  - Mrs. White: —
  - Mr. Green: —
  - Mrs. Peacock: —
- Only Miss Scarlet remains unmarked in the suspect category

**Analysis:**
- Since 5/6 suspects are crossed off from being in the solution:
  - Circle Miss Scarlet in the Solution column
  - This confirms Miss Scarlet is the murderer
  - You can now focus on determining the weapon and room
  - In your next turn, only ask about suspects you have in your hand (or a suspect knowlingly held by another player but is far away) 
  combined with cards you're investigating✗ for all others (including Solution) for these same cards

### Example 2: Must-Have Deduction
**Scenario:**
- P1 suggests: Plum, Candlestick, Ballroom
- P2 shows a card
- You already know P2 doesn't have Plum or Candlestick

**Analysis:**
- P2 must have Ballroom
- Mark ✓ for P2: Ballroom

## Digital Implementation Tips

For online Clue:

1. **Physical tracking system:**
   - Use a spreadsheet or notepad alongside the digital game
   - Color-code your marks for faster visual processing
   - Create a template you can quickly fill in for each new game
   - Make sure it's easily erasable

2. **Time optimization:**
   - Prepare your next suggestion while other players are taking their turns
   - Update your grid immediately after each information exchange
   - Group cards by certainty status to identify optimal suggestion combinations

3. **Digital shortcuts:**
   - Use a digital note-taking system with keyboard shortcuts
   - Create a simple program to help track and analyze the game state
   - Consider tracking probabilities for uncertain cards

## Variant: Ultimate Detective

The "Ultimate Detective" variant adds a unique twist: players reveal that they have a card from a suggestion without specifying which card. This creates special opportunities for deduction.

### Ultimate Detective Algorithm

```
When making a suggestion in Ultimate Detective mode:
    Count how many players (including yourself) indicate they have a card from your suggestion
    
    If the total equals the number of cards in the suggestion (typically 3):
        Cross off (—) all cards in that suggestion from being in the solution
        Still mark each card with a colored question mark (e.g., ?Red)
        This preserves the information for normal deduction purposes
        
    For example:
        You suggest: Miss Scarlet, Rope, Conservatory
        You have the Rope
        Two other players indicate they have one of these cards
        All 3 cards are accounted for, so cross off all 3 from the solution
        Still mark them with ?Red for the players who might have them
```

### Ultimate Detective Optimization

```
Strategic suggestions in Ultimate Detective mode:
    
    1. If you've already identified one solution card (e.g., circled the suspect):
        Include that known card in your suggestion
        If the total hands raised equals 3, you know the other two cards aren't in the solution
        If the total hands raised equals 2, one of the remaining cards must be in the solution
        
    2. When you're down to just a few possibilities:
        Make a suggestion with cards you suspect are in the solution
        If few or no players have these cards, your suspicion is confirmed
        
    3. Early game efficiency:
        Make suggestions where you hold one of the cards
        This guarantees at least one response and maximizes information gained per turn
